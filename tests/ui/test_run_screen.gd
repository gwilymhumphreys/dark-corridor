extends GutTest
## Phase 4 Step 4 — the run-screen state machine drives a full descent in real time,
## mirroring AutoTestMode.run_full. Driven here by manual _physics_process(delta) calls
## (synchronous — no awaited frames), so each fight ticks ~8 sim-steps per call and the
## whole run resolves fast. The autotest remains the broader headless backstop; this
## confirms the screen's FSM glue (enter beat → fight/rest → draft → advance → win).
